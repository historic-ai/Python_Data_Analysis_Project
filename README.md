# Data Handling & Analysis Project

## Description
This is a Python project focused on **cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the Titanic dataset**. The project demonstrates basic **data handling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization skills** using Python. It is designed for beginners looking to showcase Python and data analysis skills.

## Dataset
- The project uses the **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).  
- The dataset contains information about passengers, including **age, gender, class, fare, and survival status**.

## Features
- Cleaned missing values in `Age` and `Embarked` columns.
- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand survival patterns.
- Analyzed survival rates by **passenger class** and **gender**.
- Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Download the `titanic.csv` dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project folder.  
2. Open the Python script `data_analysis.py`.  
3. Run the script using Python:  
```bash
The script will display data insights and generate visualizations.

Insights

Total survivors vs non-survivors.

Survival rate by Passenger Class: 1st class had the highest survival rate.

Survival rate by Gender: Females had a higher survival rate than males.

Visual charts help to easily interpret survival trends.
